irssi::bitlbee\_nick\_instances
=============================

A hash. Bitlbee instances, each of which connects to multiple services and
accounts. Typically one would Use this for non-IRC services (eg jabber, gtalk).

Each entry creates a bitlbee instance configured by a single configuration file.

Keys are usernames for each of the bitblee instances.
Values are a hash to configure their bitlbee instance and the services it
connects to.
Valid keys for that hash:

* nick\_hashed\_password (string) - Your hashed bitlbee identify password. You
  can generate a new one by running `bitlbee -x hash $new_password`. See [wiki
page](http://wiki.bitlbee.org/DecodingPasswords) for more details.
* accounts (array) - see `accounts` section
* channels (array) - see `channels` section


irssi::bitlbee\_nick\_instances - accounts
----------------------------------------

Each element is a hash that populates a single
user:account node. Available keys in this hash:

* `account_options` (hash) - populates attributes of user:accounts xml
  node. Keys are attribute names, values (strings) are the attribute values.
  Valid keys:

    * `handle` (string)
    * `password` (string): password for that account encrypted using your
      identify password as the key. Value can be obtained using
      `bitlbee -x enc $account_password $identify_password`.
    * `protocol` (string): One of bitlbee's supported protocols, eg `jabber`,
      `msn`, `twitter`.

    Other valid keys such as `server` can also be set using the `settings` hash,
    described below. (Proof: [the
    source](https://github.com/vmiklos/bitlbee/blob/master/storage_xml.c#L94).)

* `settings (hash)` - one entry per user:accounts:setting node. Key sets the
  value of the `name` attribute; value (string) is the node value. See the
  [`account set` wiki
  article](http://wiki.bitlbee.org/Commands#account_.3Caccount_id.3E_set).


irssi::bitlbee\_nick\_instances - channels
----------------------------------------

Add an entry to this hash for each chatroom you care about.

Each element is a hash that populate a single
user:channel xml node. Available keys in this hash:

* `name` (string) - populates the name attribute on the user:channel node.
  `name` should begin with a `&amp;` or `#`.
* `type` (string) - populates the type attribute on the user:channel node. If
  name begins with `&`, `type` should be `'control'`. Otherwise it should be
  `chat`. You should have at least one control channel. See `help channels` for
  more info.
* `settings` (hash) - one entry per user:channel:setting node. Key populates the
  name attribute, value (string) is the node value. Complete list of available
  settings can be seen by using `channel <channel_id> set`. Here are some:
    * `'chat_type'`: eg, `'room'`
    * `'room'`: The address of the chat room, eg
      `'secretroom@conference.jabber.foobar.com'`
    * `'password'`: The password for the room, if applicable
    * `'auto_join'`: `'true'`, `'false'`
